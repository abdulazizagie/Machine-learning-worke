# Machine Learning File Overview
#### In this machine learning file, I worked on various machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and model optimization strategies, including:

- Simple Linear Regression – Implemented both using the default library function (LinearRegression from Scikit-Learn) and manually from scratch, calculating coefficients using the least squares method or gradient descent.
- 3D Plotting – Visualizing data in three dimensions using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for better data understanding.
- Web Scraping – Extracting data from websites using tools like BeautifulSoup and Scrapy to gather datasets for machine learning projects.
- Working with Files – Reading, writing, and handling files (CSV, Excel, JSON) for data storage and retrieval.
- SimpleImputer – Handling missing data by replacing missing values with mean, median, mode, or other strategies.
Pipeline – Automating the machine learning workflow by combining preprocessing steps and models into a single pipeline, improving efficiency and reproducibility.
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis) – Reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional datasets while retaining important information, improving model performance and efficiency.
- Outlier Detection – Identifying and handling outliers using techniques like the Z-score method, IQR method, and machine learning algorithms to improve model accuracy.
- Machine Learning Models – Implementing and evaluating various models, including regression, classification, and clustering algorithms.
- Iterative Imputer – A more advanced method for handling missing data by predicting missing values based on other available features.
- Handling Data – Data preprocessing techniques such as cleaning, transformation, normalization, and feature engineering.
- Gradient Descent – An optimization algorithm used to minimize errors in models by adjusting model parameters iteratively, especially in deep learning and linear regression.
- Encoding – Converting categorical variables into numerical formats using techniques like one-hot encoding and label encoding for machine learning models.
- Column Transformer – Applying different transformations to different types of features in a dataset, useful when handling both numerical and categorical data.
- Box-Cox Transformation – A technique used to stabilize variance and make data more normally distributed, which helps improve the performance of certain models.

### This file covers a wide range of machine learning concepts, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model building and optimization, making it a comprehensive resource for practical machine learning applications.
